# Introduction {-}

Write short intro

# Primary stuff/graphs  {-}

Do some descriptive statistics and exploratory data work

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r }



```





#  Results {-}

Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]
```{r}

```


## Part B {-}
```{r}

```
