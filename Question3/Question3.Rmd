# Introduction \label{Introduction}

In this report, I delve into the characteristics of two iconic bands, Coldplay and Metallica, exploring their studio albums in terms of popularity, style, and emotion. I analyse various factors such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo to gain insights into the unique attributes of their music. Additionally, we examine the emotions evoked by their albums, focusing on happiness and sadness as key emotional indicators. By delving into these aspects, we aim to uncover the distinct features that define the music of Coldplay and Metallica, providing a deeper understanding of their artistic expressions.

# Part A
In this section I explore the popularity per album of each band.

## Coldplay
```{r}
library(glue)
popularity_plot(coldplay_studio, "Popularity per Album (Coldplay)")
```


This graph shows that the most popular album of Coldplay is "Parachutes", with the most favoured song "Yellow".

## Metallica
```{r}
popularity_plot(metallica_studio, "Popularity per Album (Metallica")


```
This graph shows that the most popular album of Metallica is "Metallica", with the most favoured song "Enter Sandman".

Based on popularity, Coldplay is favoured over Metallica.

# Part B
In this section I explore the style of the bands' styles across different albums.

## Coldplay

```{r, fig.height=8,fig.width=10, out.extra='angle=90'}
create_style_evolution_plot(coldplay_studio, "Evolution of Coldplay's Style")
```

Among all the albums, "A Rush of Blood to the Head" stands out for its remarkable combination of acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo. On the other hand, the most popular album, "Parachutes," does not exhibit any distinctive characteristics that distinguish it from the other albums.

## Metallica
```{r, fig.height=8,fig.width=10, out.extra='angle=90'}
create_style_evolution_plot(metallica_studio, "Evolution of Metallica's Style")

```

In general, Metallica's albums exhibit lower levels of speechiness compared to Coldplay. Furthermore, when it comes to danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, valence, and tempo, Metallica's albums diverge significantly from Coldplay's, showcasing a distinct and more pronounced range.

# Part C
In this section, I explore the emotional characteristics of each album, focusing on two primary emotions: "Happy" and "Sad". To simplify the analysis, I selected specific variables such as acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, loudness, speechiness, valence, and tempo. I established threshold values for each variable by referencing the emotional qualities of Coldplay's saddest and happiest songs, leveraging my familiarity with their music.

## Coldplay

```{r}
classify_album_emotion(coldplay_studio, "Emotion Classification by Album (Coldplay)")
```

Overall, Coldplay's albums exhibit "Sad" characteristics.

# Metallica
```{r}
classify_album_emotion(metallica_studio, "Emotion Classification by Album(Metallica)")

```

Metallica's albums showcase a noteworthy blend of "Happy" and deeply emotive compositions. While some albums lean towards a more uplifting and energetic vibe, others delve into profound emotional depths. This observation resonates with our earlier analysis of their style, illuminating the multifaceted nature of Metallica's music. By exploring both the stylistic elements and the range of emotions conveyed in their albums, we gain a richer understanding of the artistic complexity that defines Metallica's discography.

# Discussion
In conclusion, by considering your desired mood, whether it be "Happy" or "Sad," you can now select an album that perfectly aligns with your emotional state. Coldplay's music is a poignant choice if you seek a heartfelt catharsis, as their compositions resonate deeply and evoke emotional responses. On the other hand, Metallica's albums offer a rich tapestry of artistic complexity, providing a captivating journey that demands attentive listening. However, it's worth noting that Metallica's music is best appreciated when experienced in a deliberate sequence rather than on shuffle mode. Regardless of your preference, both Coldplay and Metallica offer profound musical experiences tailored to your desired emotional landscape.
