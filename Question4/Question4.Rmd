  This report delves into several key aspects of the film industry, including the dominant genre, country, source of entertainment, dominant actors and directors, as well as a movie recommendation generator based on these specifications. By analyzing these elements, I uncover the prevalent genres and countries in the industry to identifying influential actors and directors. Furthermore, the movie recommendation generator serves as a practical tool for personalised film suggestions, taking into account specific preferences and criteria.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

In this comprehensive report, I delve into various aspects of the movie industry, exploring genres, entertainment types, dominant countries, influential actors and directors, and even a movie generation recommender. Through meticulous analysis and visualization, I aim to provide insights into the fascinating world of movies, shedding light on trends, preferences, and recommendations. From examining popular genres to uncovering dominant production countries, this report offers a diverse perspective on the cinematic landscape.

# Part A
In this section I explore the most popular genres.
Trends in Netflix content

```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(knitr)
library(maps)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(pacman)
library(ggpubr)
library(tseries)  
library(dynlm)
library(zoo)
library(sandwich)
library(car)
library(vars)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(extrafont)
library(urca)
library(lmtest)
library(plm)
library(lfe)
library(geepack)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# Calculate the count of each genre
genre_counts <- netflix %>%
  unnest_tokens(genre, genres) %>%
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)

# Get the most popular genre
most_popular_genre <- genre_counts$genre[1]

# Calculate the count of each type (movies or shows)
type_counts <- netflix %>%
  count(type)

# Get the most popular type
most_popular_type <- type_counts$type[which.max(type_counts$n)]

# Create a bar plot for genre counts


# Create a bar plot with different colors for each genre
ggplot(genre_counts, aes(x = genre, y = n, fill = genre)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Genre", y = "Count", title = "Genre Distribution") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  annotate("text", x = most_popular_genre, y = genre_counts$n[1], label = paste("Most Popular Genre:", most_popular_genre),
           vjust = -0.8, hjust = 0, color = "red") +
  coord_flip()
```


Based on the graph presented above, it is evident that the most popular genre among the analyzed movies is drama, followed by comedy and thriller. On the other hand, the least popular genre appears to be western. These findings shed light on the preferences of viewers, highlighting the widespread appeal of emotionally engaging narratives and the enduring popularity of comedic and suspenseful storytelling.

Moving forward, let's delve into the analysis of entertainment types to determine whether movies or shows hold greater popularity among audiences.


```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=6}
# Create a bar plot for type counts
ggplot(type_counts, aes(x = type, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Type", y = "Count", title = "Type Distribution") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.3, color = "black", size = 4) 

```

The graph clearly illustrates that movies enjoy a higher level of popularity compared to shows. This finding indicates that audiences have a stronger preference for movies as their preferred form of entertainment. 


# Country-wide Analysis
In this section, I present a visual representation of the top 10 countries in terms of dominant movie productions. By mapping these countries, we can gain valuable insights into the global landscape of the film industry and identify the key players in movie production.

```{r}
# Load map data for the world
world_map <- map_data("world")

# Count the number of titles by country
country_counts <- netflix %>%
  unnest_tokens(country, production_countries) %>%
  count(country) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))

# Define a named vector of country codes and names
countries <- c(
  "us" = "USA",
  "in" = "India",
  "gb" = "UK",
  "jp" = "Japan",
  "fr" = "France",
  "ca" = "Canada",
  "es" = "Spain",
  "kr" = "South Korea",
  "de" = "Germany",
  "cn" = "China"
)

# Replace country codes with country names
country_counts$country <- countries[country_counts$country]

# Calculate the percentage of movies made in each country
country_counts <- country_counts %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)

# Merge data with map data
merged_data_map <- merge(world_map, country_counts, by.x = "region", by.y = "country", all.x = TRUE)

# Create a choropleth map with scaled fill color and percentage labels
ggplot(merged_data_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = percentage)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black", linewidth = 0.2) +
  labs(fill = "Percentage of Movies", title = "Country-wise Analysis") +
  theme_map()

```


# Dominant actors and directors

In this section, I delve into the world of cinema to identify the top actors and directors per country and genre, based on their IMDb scores. By analyzing the IMDb scores, which serve as a measure of critical acclaim and audience appreciation, we can determine the leading talents in the film industry across different countries and genres. This exploration allows us to highlight the exceptional performances and directorial prowess that have garnered recognition and acclaim within their respective fields.

```{r}

# Define a named vector of country codes and names
top_countries <- c(
  "us" = "USA",
  "in" = "India",
  "gb" = "UK",
  "jp" = "Japan",
  "fr" = "France",
  "ca" = "Canada",
  "es" = "Spain",
  "kr" = "South Korea",
  "de" = "Germany",
  "cn" = "China"
)

# Find the top actor per country and genre based on IMDb score

filtered_data <- netflix %>%
  unnest_tokens(country, production_countries) %>%
  filter(country %in% names(top_countries)) %>%
  unnest_tokens(genre, genres) %>%
  group_by(country, genre) %>%
  filter(imdb_score == max(imdb_score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  dplyr::select(country, genre, name, role, imdb_score)

table_actor <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(role == "ACTOR",
         country!="kr") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(dominating_actor = first(name), dominating_genre = first(genre)) %>%
  arrange(country)

table_director <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(role == "DIRECTOR",
         country!="kr") %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(dominating_director = first(name), dominating_genre = first(genre)) %>%
  arrange(country)


knitr::kables(
  list(
    # the first kable() to change column names
    knitr::kable(
      table_actor, col.names = c('Country Code', 'Dominating Actor', 'Dominating Genre'), valign = 't'
    , caption = "Dominant Actors"),
    # the second kable() to set the digits option
    knitr::kable(table_actor, col.names = c('Country Code', 'Dominating Director', 'Dominating Genre'), valign = 't',caption = "Dominant Directors"
    ))
)


```

# Movie recommendation
For an entertaining twist, I have developed a movie generation recommender based on the exploratory analysis conducted. Specifically, I focused on a combination of criteria, including the name "Caterina Murino," production countries limited to the United States, a minimum IMDb score of 8, and the genre specified as drama. By leveraging these parameters, the recommender system suggests movies that align with these specific preferences.

```{r}
source("code/generate_movie_recommendation.R")
generate_movie_recommendation(netflix, name=="Caterina Murino", production_countries=="['US']", imdb_score>=8, genres=="['drama']")
```

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this report has taken us on a captivating journey through the realm of movies. We have witnessed the popularity of different genres, with drama, comedy, and thriller taking the lead. The exploration of entertainment types revealed movies to be the favored choice among audiences. By mapping dominant movie production countries, we gained a deeper understanding of the global nature of the film industry. Additionally, identifying top actors and directors based on IMDb scores showcased the talent and influence of these individuals across countries and genres.

To add an extra touch of enjoyment, I even developed a movie generation recommender, tailored to specific criteria, such as the name of an actress, desired production countries, IMDb score, and preferred genre. This tool serves as a fun way to discover captivating films that meet your specific preferences.
